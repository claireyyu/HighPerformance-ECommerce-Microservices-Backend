# System Architecture

## Overview

The system is built as a microservices-based e-commerce platform with a focus on high performance and scalability. It uses an event-driven architecture with Kafka for asynchronous message processing.

## Components

### 1. API Gateway
- Port: 8080
- Role: Entry point for all client requests
- Features:
  - Request routing
  - Load balancing
  - Basic request validation
  - Rate limiting

### 2. Product Service
- Port: 8081
- Role: Product catalog management
- Features:
  - CRUD operations for products
  - Event publishing for product updates
  - Supports both sync and async modes
- Database: MySQL (product_db)

### 3. Order Service
- Port: 8082
- Role: Order processing
- Features:
  - Order creation and management
  - Integration with Product Service
  - Asynchronous order processing
  - Supports both sync and async modes
- Database: MySQL (order_db)

### 4. Message Queue (Kafka)
- Port: 9092
- Topics:
  - product-events (6 partitions)
  - order-events (6 partitions)
- Features:
  - Event streaming
  - Message persistence
  - Partition management
  - Consumer group management

### 5. Database (MySQL)
- Port: 3306
- Databases:
  - product_db
  - order_db
- Features:
  - Data persistence
  - Transaction management
  - User authentication

## Event Flow

1. **Product Creation (Async)**
   ```
   Client -> API Gateway -> Product Service -> Kafka -> Order Service
   ```

2. **Order Creation (Async)**
   ```
   Client -> API Gateway -> Order Service -> Kafka -> Product Service
   ```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Each service can be scaled independently
   - Kafka partitions enable parallel processing
   - Database read replicas for read-heavy operations

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Redis for frequently accessed data
   - Local cache for static data
   - Cache invalidation via events

3. **Load Balancing**
   - Round-robin distribution
   - Health check monitoring
   - Circuit breaker implementation

## Monitoring

1. **Metrics Collection**
   - Prometheus for metrics
   - Grafana for visualization
   - Custom metrics for business KPIs

2. **Logging**
   - Centralized logging
   - Log aggregation
   - Error tracking

## Security

1. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - API key management

2. **Data Protection**
   - TLS encryption
   - Data encryption at rest
   - Secure credential management

## Deployment

1. **Container Orchestration**
   - Docker containers
   - Kubernetes/EKS
   - Service mesh (optional)

2. **CI/CD**
   - Automated testing
   - Blue-green deployment
   - Rollback procedures
